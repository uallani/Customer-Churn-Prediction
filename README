Customer Churn Prediction

Overview

Customer churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses aiming to retain their customers. This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data. By identifying potential churners, businesses can take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key patterns and trends in customer behavior.

Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating the most relevant features for prediction.

Model Training & Evaluation: Training various machine learning models and evaluating their performance.

Deployment: Exporting the trained model for real-world use.
